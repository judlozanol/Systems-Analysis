\section{Conclusion}

From a system's point of view, the AI Football Competition illustrates a complex interplay between inputs (agent submissions and parameters), processing (match simulations and learning methods), and outputs (performance grades and research outcomes). The design of the system facilitates scalable evaluation via auto-matching, whereby agents of similar skill levels compete in sandboxed environments. This setup guarantees scalability and perpetual benchmarking, with participants able to tune their models according to observations from the leaderboard.

The system also has some contemporary limitations since it operates in a closed-loop fashion. The simulation provides structured observations, including the position of the players, where the ball travels, and game state. Still, it operates within a structured environment, discluding real-life challenges such as environmental conditions and human unpredictability. The structured action space prevents unusual behaviors as agents cannot implement unorthodox strategies outside designated actions. Furthermore, while the rating system is effective for establishing rankings, it may inadvertently encourage conservative playing styles that exploit limitations in simulation rather than showcasing genuine football skills.

Future improvements could include adding complexity by adding changing factors, like changing pitch conditions and referee mistakes, and adaptive rules that change depending on the agents' performance. A feedback loop based on real match data could also help connect the simulation back to reality. Ultimately, the strength of the competition is in the pipelined evaluation framework, but its long-term sustainability is in accepting the messy, nonlinear systems that characterize real football where agents have to deal not only with adversaries, but with the intrinsic uncertainty of the game itself.
