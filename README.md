# Systems-Analysis
This repository was created with the propose of deliver the workshops corresponding to the subject "System Analysis" of the career Systems Engineering in Francisco Jos√© de Caldas University.

## Workshop 1. Kaggle Systems Engineering Analysis
In this workshop was selected a Kaggle competition related to training of IA Agents to play a soccer simulator game to make a systemic analysis of it. Going from the description of the competition as a system, to the identification of characteristic elements of a systems like sensitivity, or Chaos Theory.

## Workshop 2. Kaggle Systems Design 
Building on Workshop 1's analysis, this project designs a Reinforcement Learning agent (PPO algorithm) for the Google Research Football competition, implementing input/output adapters for data standardization, an action chooser with RL decision-making, position-specific reward systems, and model backups to prevent training regressions, using Python with TensorFlow Agents and Docker.
