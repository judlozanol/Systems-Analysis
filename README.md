# Systems-Analysis
This repository was created with the propose of deliver the workshops corresponding to the subject "System Analysis" of the career Systems Engineering in Francisco Jos√© de Caldas University.

## Workshop 1. Kaggle Systems Engineering Analysis
In this workshop was selected a Kaggle competition related to training of IA Agents to play a soccer simulator game to make a systemic analysis of it. Going from the description of the competition as a system, to the identification of characteristic elements of a systems like sensitivity, or Chaos Theory.

## Workshop 2. Kaggle Systems Design 
Building on Workshop 1's analysis, this project designs a Reinforcement Learning agent (PPO algorithm) for the Google Research Football competition, implementing input/output adapters for data standardization, an action chooser with RL decision-making, position-specific reward systems, and model backups to prevent training regressions, using Python with TensorFlow Agents and Docker.

## Workshop 3. Kaggle System Simulation
In this workshop was compiled the principal outcomes from Workshops 1 and 2 to design simulation enviroments from our IA Agent. Beeing the Google Research Football enviroment a key element for those simulations. Also was used the library Tensorboard to effectively representate the results of training proccess, allowing us to do some final conclusions around emergent behaviors and the efectivity of the first design done.

## Final Delivery
In this section of the repository you are going to find the summary of all the proccess of resolving the Kaggle competition by applying system analysis and design principles. You will also have access to the solution done, and the respective requiriments to try it. Finally, some auxiliar documents like a paper or a poster were generated to improve understanding in the solution.
